Jouzu desu ne!” was created to help you (and me. Mostly me) improve your knowledge of Japanese. 
It’s modelled after flashcard systems used to learn all sorts of things (nor just languages), specifically the Anki Core 2k deck, where the app’s card database was originally extracted from.  
Ideally, you should be able to read Hiragana and Katakana (two of the four Japanese alphabets) in order to use “Jouzu desu ne!” to the fullest. In the future I’d love to add Hiragana and Katakana flashcards to the app too.

More info coming soon! Meanwhile, you can try out Jouzu Desu Ne! here: https://jouzudesune.netlify.app/
