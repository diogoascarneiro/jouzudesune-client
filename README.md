# Intro
** "Jouzu desu ne!" is what everyone wants to hear back from a native speaker when talking to them in Japanese. Let's make it happen! **

"Jouzu desu ne!” (上手ですね!, which translates to something like "You're really good \[at Japanese\]!") was created to help you (and me. Mostly me) improve your knowledge of Japanese, especially Kanji. It’s modelled after flashcard systems used to learn all sorts of things (nor just languages), specifically the Anki Core 2k deck (which lists two thousand of the most common Japanese words in daily use) where the app’s card database was originally extracted from.  Ideally, you should be able to read Hiragana and Katakana (two of the four Japanese alphabets) in order to use “Jouzu desu ne!” to the fullest, although it's not absolutely essential.

## Technologies used

"Jouzu desu ne!" was built using the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express, React & Node.js. Styling was done using TailwindCSS coupled with DaisyUI. HeadlessUI is also used for animations, with some other npm packages (such as React-Flippy) providing additional functionality. The app uses version 17 of React.

## Future features I intend to add:
* Hiragana & Katakana learning mode;
* More social components: A leaderboard, public user profiles & user messaging;
* Even more decks;
* A lives system for decks;
* A progression system where higher difficulty decks are unlocked after you complete more basic ones.
* Card questions based on the hiragana for the card in addition to its meaning.
